# A Linear-Gaussin Latent Factor (Feature) Model using a IBP prior

This Python code implements a linear-Gaussian latent factor model using a Indian buffet process prior as illustrated in Griffiths and Ghahramani (2011). 

It uses a truncated IBP prior that has a upperbound of the numebr of latent features K.
